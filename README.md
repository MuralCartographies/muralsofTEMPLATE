This repository provides a basic template for building your own website for documenting murals. After you have forked this repo make sure to switch to gh-pages for your source.

Basically this contains the structure for creating and maintaining a simple website as well as files and other content for a project. To customize this for your own needs you can edit the following files:

index.html

about.html

data.html

map.html

contact.html

and the README.md

What do you need?

1. A dataset of murals to put into google sheets. Go out and take your own pictures. Find murals online or at a library. It doesn't matter. You just need a few murals to get started. No murals in your town? Go out and find places that you want to see murals!

2. A google docs account in order to create a google sheet from your mural data. Take your data and put it into google sheets. You can use the metadata template to get started: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rEeWW5pnvNpixm__2F708SBjppZW8hmoI2JSfLCLKMY/edit?usp=sharing

3. A CARTO account to create a map. It doesn't have to be CARTO. You can use anything! Check out the TechConnect talk "We Mapped It So You Donâ€™t Have To: Comparing mapping platforms for Digital Humanities projects" for other ideas.
