This repository provides a basic template for building your own website for documenting murals. 

What do you need? 

1. A dataset of murals to put into google sheets.
Go out and take your own pictures. Find murals online or at a library. It doesn't matter. You just need a few murals to get started.
No murals in your town? Go out and find places that you want to see murals!
2. A google docs account in order to create a google sheet from your mural data. Take your data and put it into google sheets.
You can use the metadata template to get started: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rEeWW5pnvNpixm__2F708SBjppZW8hmoI2JSfLCLKMY/edit?usp=sharing
3. A CARTO account to create a map.
