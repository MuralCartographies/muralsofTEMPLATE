# Intro

This repository provides a basic template for building your own website for documenting murals. After you have forked this repo make sure to switch to gh-pages as your source in the settings if it hasn't already.

Basically this contains the structure for creating and maintaining a simple website as well as files and other content for a project. To customize this for your own needs you can start by editing the following files:

_config.yml

index.html

about.html

data.html

map.html

contact.html

and the README.md

# What do you need to make a map?

1. A dataset of murals to put into google sheets. Go out and take your own pictures. Find murals online or at a library. It doesn't matter. You just need a few murals to get started. No murals in your town? Go out and find places that you want to see murals! Your map could help identify potential sites for murals.

2. A google docs account in order to create a google sheet from your mural data. Take your data and put it into google sheets. You can use the metadata template to get started: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rEeWW5pnvNpixm__2F708SBjppZW8hmoI2JSfLCLKMY/edit?usp=sharing

3. A CARTO account to create a map - https://carto.com/. It doesn't have to be CARTO. You can use anything! Check out the TechConnect talk "We Mapped It So You Donâ€™t Have To: Comparing mapping platforms for Digital Humanities projects" for other ideas.

# Lets add some data to CARTO and then publish it in GitHub
